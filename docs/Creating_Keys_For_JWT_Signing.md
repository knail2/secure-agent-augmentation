Below are detailed, step-by-step instructions and recommendations:

**Recommended Cryptography Algorithms**  
- **RSA (most common)**: For OAuth 2.0 JWT signing, RSA keys (2048-bit or higher) are widely supported and considered secure. Common JWT signature algorithms using RSA are `RS256` (SHA-256 with RSA) and `RS512`.  
- **EC (Elliptic Curve)**: ECDSA keys (e.g., P-256) can also be used if your authorization server and clients support `ES256` or other ECDSA-based JWT signing algorithms.  
- **EdDSA (Ed25519)**: Modern and efficient, but ensure your server and libraries support it before choosing this option.

**Step-by-Step Instructions Using OpenSSL (for RSA Keys)**

1. **Ensure OpenSSL is Installed**  
   - On Linux/Unix systems, OpenSSL is often already installed.  
   - Verify by running:  
     ```bash
     openssl version
     ```
   - If not available, install via your package manager (e.g., `apt-get install openssl` or `brew install openssl` on macOS).

2. **Create the Private Key Directory**  
   - Make sure you have a `.ssh` directory in your HOME path:  
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.ssh
     chmod 700 ~/.ssh
     ```
   
3. **Generate the Private Key**  
   - Use `openssl` to generate a 2048-bit RSA private key:  
     ```bash
     openssl genrsa -out ~/.ssh/jwt_private_key.pem 2048
     ```
   - This creates a private key named `jwt_private_key.pem` in the `~/.ssh` directory.

4. **Set File Permissions (Optional but Recommended)**  
   - Restrict access to the private key:  
     ```bash
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/jwt_private_key.pem
     ```

5. **Extract the Public Key**  
   - Using the private key, generate a corresponding public key:  
     ```bash
     openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/jwt_private_key.pem -pubout -out ~/.ssh/jwt_public_key.pem
     ```
   - This creates a `jwt_public_key.pem` file in the same directory.

6. **Verify the Keys**  
   - Check the private key:  
     ```bash
     openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/jwt_private_key.pem -check
     ```
   - Check the public key:  
     ```bash
     openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/jwt_public_key.pem -pubin -text -noout
     ```
   
7. **Integrate with Your OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server**  
   - Once the keys are created, update your server configuration to use `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` as shown in your code snippet.

**Summary**
- Use `openssl` to generate an RSA key pair.  
- Private key: `~/.ssh/jwt_private_key.pem`  
- Public key: `~/.ssh/jwt_public_key.pem`  
- Ensure correct permissions and integrate into your OAuth 2.0 authorization server to sign and verify JWT access tokens.
